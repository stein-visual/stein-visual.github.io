                            <p>The Owner takes appropriate security measures to prevent unauthorized access, disclosure,
                            modification, or unauthorized destruction of the Data.<br>

                            The Data processing is carried out using computers and/or IT enabled tools, following
                            organizational procedures and modes strictly related to the purposes indicated. In addition

                            legal, system administration) or external parties (such as third-party technical service

                            <h4>Legal basis of processing</h4>

                            <p>The Owner may process Personal Data relating to Users if one of the following applies:</p>
                            <ul>

                                    objects to such processing ("opt-out"), without having to rely on consent or any
                                    other of the following legal bases. This, however, does not apply, whenever the
                                    processing of Personal Data is subject to European data protection law;
                                </li>

                            situation to justify the objection.</p>

                            <p>Users must know that, however, should their Personal Data be processed for direct
                            marketing purposes, they can object to that processing at any time without providing any
                            justification. To learn, whether the Owner is processing Personal Data for direct marketing
                            purposes, Users may refer to the relevant sections of this document.</p>

                            identifiers, commercial information, internet information, geolocation data and employment
                            related information.</p>

                            <p>We will not collect additional categories of personal information without notifying you.</p>

                            <h5><i>How we collect information: what are the sources of the personal information we

                            <p>We collect the above mentioned categories of personal information, either directly or
                            indirectly, from you when you use this Application.</p>

                            <p>For example, you directly provide your personal information when you submit requests via
                            any forms on this Application. You also provide personal information indirectly when you
                            navigate this Application, as personal information about you is automatically observed and
                            collected. Finally, we may collect your personal information from third parties that work
                            with us in connection with the Service or with the functioning of this Application and

                            business purposes. In this case, we enter a written agreement with such third party that
                            requires the recipient to both keep the personal information confidential and not use it for
                            any purpose(s) other than those necessary for the performance of the agreement.</p>

                            <p>We may also disclose your personal information to third parties when you explicitly ask
                            or authorize us to do so, in order to provide you with our Service.</p>

                            <p>To find out more about the purposes of processing, please refer to the relevant section

                            <h5><i>Sale of your personal information</i></h5>

                            <p>For our purposes, the word "sale" means any "selling, renting, releasing, disclosing,
                            disseminating, making available, transferring or otherwise communicating orally, in writing,
                            or by electronic means, a consumer's personal information by the business to <strong>another
                            business or a third party, for monetary or other valuable consideration</strong>".</p>

                            <p>This means that, for example, a sale can happen whenever an application runs ads, or
                            makes statistical analyses on the traffic or views, or simply because it uses tools such as
                            social network plugins and the like.</p>

                            <h5><i>Your right to opt out of the sale of personal information</i></h5>

                            <p>You have the right to opt out of the sale of your personal information. This means that

                            carried out by this Application, both online and offline, you can contact us for further

                            Application and features thereof ("business purposes"). In such cases, your personal

                            our rights before the competent authorities where our rights and interests are threatened or
                            we suffer an actual damage.</p>

                            <p>We will not use your personal information for different, unrelated, or incompatible
                            purposes without notifying you.</p>

                            by contacting us via the details provided in this document.</p>

                            <p>For us to respond to your request, it's necessary that we know who you are. Therefore,
                            you can only exercise the above rights by making a verifiable request which must:</p>

                            <ul>

                                    provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the
                                    person about whom we collected personal information or an authorized representative;
                                </li>

                                    describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand,
                                    evaluate, and respond to it.
                                </li>
                            </ul>

                            <p>We will not respond to any request if we are unable to verify your identity and therefore
                            confirm the personal information in our possession actually relates to you.</p>

                            <p>If you cannot personally submit a verifiable request, you can authorize a person
                            registered with the California Secretary of State to act on your behalf.</p>

                            <p>If you are an adult, you can make a verifiable request on behalf of a minor under your
                            parental authority.</p>

                            <p>You can submit a maximum number of 2 requests over a period of 12 months.</p>

                            <h5><i>How and when we are expected to handle your request</i></h5>

                            <p>We will confirm receipt of your verifiable request within 10 days and provide information
                            about how we will process your request.</p>

                            <p>We will respond to your request within 45 days of its receipt. Should we need more time,
                            we will explain to you the reasons why, and how much more time we need. In this regard,
                            please note that we may take up to 90 days to fulfill your request.</p>

                            <p>Our disclosure(s) will cover the preceding 12 month period.</p>

                            <p>Should we deny your request, we will explain you the reasons behind our denial.</p>

                            <p>We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable request unless such
                            request is manifestly unfounded or excessive. In such cases, we may charge a reasonable fee,
                            or refuse to act on the request. In either case, we will communicate our choices and explain
                            the reasons behind it.</p>
